# üëã Hey, I'm Krypton!

Hey there, I‚Äôm Krypton! (Coming from the [Krypton element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krypton) 36 ‚öõÔ∏è) I‚Äôm a developer, security researcher and overall security enthusiast. I like computers *(surprised?)* and anything related to cyber security, especially information gathering and reverse engineering.

**I üíú open source**

### Current projects I'm working on

- **[`Project Absence`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/project-absence)** ‚Äì A security tool for domain reconnaissance with an OSINT-only approach, written in Rust.
- **crake** - A new project I won't unveil at the moment as I'm not sure how the development will be and how much time I can give to it because it's a side project I work on when I need to take my mind off other things.
- **[`Aegisbot`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/aegisbot)** - A Discord and Twitch bot with advanced pattern-matching auto-moderation, built on concepts inspired by [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/), written in Go.
- **[`OverScry`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/OverScry)** - A tool designed to simplify the process of generating Overpass queries from a YML structure file, written in Go.

### Notable other projects

- **[`wordlists`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/wordlists)** - Yet another collection of wordlists
- **[`Python-Discord-Bot-Template`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template)** - A simple template to start to code your own and personalized Discord bot in Python
- **[`spaceflake`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/spaceflake)** / **[`spaceflake.rs`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/spaceflake.rs)** - A distributed generator to create unique IDs with ease in Go/Rust; inspired by Twitter's Snowflake
- **[`rsmanuf`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/rsmanuf)** / **[`gomanuf`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/gomanuf)**/ **[`pymanuf`](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/pymanuf)** - A very simple Rust/Go/Python library to get the manufacturer of a specific MAC address

### Currently learning

- **Hardening/Purple Teaming** - After learning a lot of red teaming, I want more to make things more resistant to damages and/or attacks.
- **OSINT / Information Gathering** - Learning new techniques to gather information about specific things, I love data.
- **Rust** ‚Äì Security tooling and some other random TUIs.
- **Forensics** - Forsencis.. but digital.
